# The BankAccount class models a simple bank account.
# - The constructor (__init__) allows setting an initial balance, defaulting to 0.
# - The deposit method adds a positive amount to the balance and prints a confirmation.
#   It checks that the deposit amount is positive.
# - The withdraw method subtracts a positive amount from the balance if there are sufficient funds.
#   It checks for both positive input and sufficient balance, printing appropriate messages.
# - The balance method returns the current balance.
# The class uses a private attribute (_balance) to store the account balance, following Python's naming convention for "protected" members.
# This class can be extended with more features such as transaction history, interest calculation, etc.

# Example usage:
# account = BankAccount(100)
# account.deposit(50)
# account.withdraw(30)
# print("Current balance:", account.balance())
